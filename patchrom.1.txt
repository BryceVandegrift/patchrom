Name
----
patchrom - Patch jump table into a ROM dump

Synopsis
--------
'patchrom' _CONFIG_ _ROM_ _PAGE_

Description
-----------

Patches a ROM file with a jump table and generates the necessary jump table
index definitions.

The symbols for _ROM_ are read from _stdin_, and those listed in the _CONFIG_ file
are used to generate a jump table. the generated jump table is written to the end
of _PAGE_ in the ROM file, and an include file for use in assemblers is written to
stdout.

Symbol Format
-------------

The symbols must be in a rather basic format, namely the format supported by the
sass assembler. It looks like this:

	.equ sym1 0x8
	.equ sym2 0x10
	.equ sym3 0x77
	.equ sym4 0x7A

Comments are supported by a single line starting with ; and extending to the end
of the line.

ROM Patch Format
----------------

The ROM file is patched with a jump table at the end of the specified page. The
first entry in the config file is written to the end of the page. The table
consists of the z80 JP instruction repeated for each symbol. For the symbol file
above, that would look something like this:

	C3 7A 00
	C3 77 00
	C3 10 00
	C3 08 00 # This is the end of the Flash page

Generated Include Format
------------------------

An include file will be written to stdout. Each exported symbol will have one
entry in the include file, taking the form of:

	.equ symbol_name 0xIIPP

Where _II_ is the __I__ndex of the function (where 0 is the end of the page), and
_PP_ is the Flash __P__age it appears on.

Config File Format
------------------

The config file provided must simply be a list of symbols to export. It supports
arbituary whitespace at the start of each line and you may include comments
starting with # and extending to the end of the line. An example may look like
this:

	# This is a comment
		sym1
		sym2
		sym3
		sym4

Empty lines are ignored.

Examples
--------

patchrom 00.config example.rom 0x00 < 00.sym > 00.inc::
	Patches example.rom with a jump table containing symbols listed in 00.config
	and output the jump table index definitions to 00.inc
